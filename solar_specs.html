        <h1>Solar System Specifications</h1>
        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>The solar energy system for Melbourne, VIC is designed to take into account the average climate and solar conditions of the region. Below are key factors that influence the performance and efficiency of the system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Melbourne, VIC</li>
            <li><strong>Average Daily Insolation:</strong> 4.11 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (Horizontal), 4.75 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> (30&deg; Tilt). Insolation represents the average daily solar radiation received per unit area. A higher value means more potential energy generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Annual Temperature:</strong> 19.8&deg;C. Temperature affects the efficiency of the solar panels; a higher temperature may lead to reduced efficiency due to increased resistance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solar Panel Specifications</h2>
        <p>Our solar panel selection includes three models, each offering different power ratings and features:</p>
        <h3>SLX170</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Rating:</strong> 170 W. This value represents the maximum power the panel can generate under standard conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer Tolerance:</strong> 3%. This means the actual power may vary by up to 3% from the rated value.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Coefficient:</strong> -0.45 %/&deg;C. Indicates how the panel's efficiency is affected by temperature changes. A negative value means efficiency decreases as temperature rises.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency Loss due to Dirt/Mismatch:</strong> 5%. Real-world conditions such as dirt accumulation or panel mismatches may reduce efficiency by up to 5%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SLX175</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Rating:</strong> 175 W</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer Tolerance:</strong> 3%</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Coefficient:</strong> -0.45 %/&deg;C</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency Loss due to Dirt/Mismatch:</strong> 5%</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SLX180</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Rating:</strong> 180 W</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturer Tolerance:</strong> 3%</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Coefficient:</strong> -0.45 %/&deg;C</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency Loss due to Dirt/Mismatch:</strong> 5%</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inverter Specifications</h2>
        <p>The inverter converts the DC power generated by the solar panels into AC power suitable for home use. The specifications for the selected inverter model are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Xantrex GT2.8</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> 90%. This means 90% of the energy generated by the panels is converted to usable AC power.</li>
            <li><strong>Cable Loss:</strong> 5%. Some energy is lost in transmission through cables, typically around 5%.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> 2.8 kW. This is the maximum power output of the inverter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Derating and Loss Factors</h2>
        <p>Derating and loss factors help to provide a realistic estimate of energy production, accounting for various inefficiencies in the system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Array Loss due to Dirt/Mismatch:</strong> 5%. Over time, dirt and minor differences between panels can lead to reduced efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature Coefficient:</strong> -0.45%/&deg;C. Efficiency decreases as the panel temperature exceeds the standard testing conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverter Efficiency:</strong> 90%. The inverter's efficiency also affects the overall energy output.</li>
            <li><strong>Cable Loss:</strong> 5%. Energy losses also occur during the transmission from the panels to the inverter.</li>
        </ul>
